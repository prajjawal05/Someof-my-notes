Suppose "abc" be a string, then 'b', may be called as its subset.
GCD(a,b)=GCD(b,a%b)
Triangular number:n is said to be triangular number if
                  8n+1 is a perfect square
                  if m=(sqrt(8m+1)-1)/2
                  then,n=(m*(m+1))/2
To read multiple words using scanf
        scanf("%[^/n]s",a);
Paiwise GCD of three consecutive numbers are 1(odd even odd)        
Distance between two iterators is found by distance(it1,it2)
Sum of etf of divisors of n = n
A pentatope number is a numbeR OF INTERSECTION OF DIAGONALS OF A POLYGON.
Total number of possible Binary Search Trees with n different keys = Catalan number Cn = (2n)!/(n+1)!*n!
A general formula to compute the length of common chord of two intersecting circles radii r1,r2 separated by a distance dd between their center = sqrt(d^2−(r1−r2)^2)((r1+r2)^2−d^2)/d
